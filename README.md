# Chroniq-RFM-Healthcare-segmentation
A healthcare analytics solution leveraging RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation to identify high-risk chronic patients, reduce readmissions, and enable data-driven care management

## Project Overview
This project empowers hospitals and healthcare professionals to stratify chronic care patients based on visit behavior and expenditure. Using RFM logic, we segment patients into High, Medium, and Low risk tiers to prioritize interventions.

## Objective
- Identify high-risk chronic care patients
- Enable proactive care based on visit & spend behavior
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for clinical, financial, and operational decision-making
- Facilitate exports and ad hoc slicing of patient data for stakeholder-specific needs

## Technologies Used
- Python (for data cleaning and preprocessing)
- Power BI (dashboard and reporting)
- Microsoft Excel (QA & UAT trackers)
- JSON (Power BI Theme Customization)
- Simulated CSV data (patients, visits, vitals, diagnosis)
